## 1.What are your scientific questions?
<br>
How have the frequency and duration of heatwave events in New York City changed over the past 4 decades?
<br>

## 2.What are your datasets?
<br>

[daily summaries data in NYC from NOAA](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/GHCND/locations/CITY:US360019/detail) and [2D data from CDS](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets)
<br>

## 3.What is the analysis that you plan to conduct?

### The trend in Heatwave Frequency: 
Temperature Anomaly Comparison between 1984 and 2024
Ratios of Record Highs to Record Lows for 4 Successive Decades in NYC / Difference between 1983 and 2023

### Trend in Heatwave Intensity: 
mapping increases in the number of days with extreme heatwaves from 1983 and 2023

### Display Climate Risks: 
Conceptual representation of the shift in the probability distribution for average and extreme temperatures as a result of global warming
<br>
## 4.What are the outcomes that you plan to achieve?
<br>
Insights into whether heatwaves are becoming more common or severe, possibly linked to climate change.
